# **Key Reasons to Use ZKsync Era**

## **Security**  
- **ZKsync Era** inherits its **security** directly from **Ethereum**.  
- If Ethereum detects an issue and rolls back, **ZKsync Era** will follow.  
- Transactions are **legitimate** and **authentic** thanks to **cryptographic validity proofs**.  

---

## **EVM Compatibility**  
- **ZKsync Era** is compatible with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**.  
- The transition remains **seamless** while it compiles smart contracts into **Era VM bytecode** instead of standard EVM bytecode.  
- Developers can deploy **Solidity-written smart contracts** on ZKsync Era with **minimal adjustments**.

---

## **Ethereum Wallet Support**  
- **ZKsync** supports **Ethereum wallets** out of the box.  
- Users can continue using existing Ethereum wallets, such as **MetaMask**, without creating a new one.  
- Wallet addresses remain the **same across both Ethereum and ZKsync Era** which simplifys the **user experience**.  

---

## **Low Cost and Scalability**  
- One of the standout features of **ZKsync Era** is its **low transaction costs** due to **transaction bundling**.  
- This approach reduces **gas fees** and ensures **scalability** as the network grows.  
- Protocols remain **efficient** and **cost-effective** by deploying on **ZKsync**. It remains this way even as the number of users increases.

---

## **Conclusion**  
These **four key reasons**—**security**, **EVM compatibility**, **wallet support**, and **low cost**—make **ZKsync Era** a **superior choice** for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.
